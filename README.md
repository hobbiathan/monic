# Monic

Not necessarly an actual crypto, or even remotely functioning under any capacity, but just something to play around with to understand blockchain technology a tad bit better

## Setup

Really, after cloning this down into the directory of your choosing, just run 


`ruby lib/runner.rb`


and see the automated example take place.

## Blockchain Difficulty

The speed at which blocks are mined within the blockchain is determined by the `difficulty` attribute in the `blockchain.rb` class - currently, it's set to a difficulty of `5`, but you're free to change it around and about to see how quickly blocks can be mined.

## Notes

Because transactions aren't signed with private/public keys, you can really just use whoever's wallet to send whatever amount to wherever, so this is really a 100% secure crypto rivaling Monero, and should definitely be used in the DeFi economy.

That, and there's also issues of decentralization, nodes, r/w to actual databases, etc.
